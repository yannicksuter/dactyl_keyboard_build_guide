#   Building my dactyl keyboard
the long journey to get my dactyl keyboard running...

Project source: [adereth/dactyl-keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard)

## Getting the parts together...
- diodes: I got 80x 1N4148 (the standard?)
- caps: todo
- flex pcb: todo
- 3d model/printing: 

## Assembly
- Coating the 3d parts: I used standard acrylic varnish. Some people recommend varnish on silicon base as it should better connect with the surface. I used varnish on water base - I had no issues with it nor problems that the paint didn't stick.
- Firmware: please read [Building a Dactyl Keyboard, Running QMK](http://joedevivo.com/2017/05/20/building-a-qmk-dactyl.html)
